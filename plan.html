<h1>CP1406 - Assignment 1 - Project Plan</h1>
<p><strong>Name:</strong> Oliver Atkinson</p>
<h2>Goals</h2>
<p>The goal of the website&rsquo;s introduction is to  improve the business of Slammer&rsquo;s Beach Volleyball. This is hoped to be  achieved by increasing the number of customers by at least 50% through promotion  of a variety of services and enabling access to those interested to sign up to  events online.</p>
<h2>Success Evaluation</h2>
<p>The website is required to increase the number of customers by at least  50% to have had the intended effect. The number of new customers should be  monitored weekly to monitor the success of the website. Secondarily, the age  demographic of the new customers will give indication whether the target  audience is being reached by the site.</p>
<h2>Target Audience</h2>
<p>The website&rsquo;s designed to encourage 15-30 year olds to sign up and  partake in the events the club provides. The site will cater to the demographic  through a variety of design choices. Younger people tend to have a shorter  attention span and skim read majority of paragraphs set in front of them.  Multiple highlighted prompts (links) to sign up will help teens get straight to  the point and engage with the club rather than having to navigate through  multiple pages to find the sign up page. Header aside, there&rsquo;ll be a prompt to  sign up on most if not all pages. The immediate call to action doesn&rsquo;t let the  young demographic lose interest before they can invest in the site. The colour  scheme would be another factor to attract teens-young adults alike. Some  vibrant colours would give the younger audience a younger, energised vibe from  the club as opposed to some dull colour pallet which could be extracted from a  birth certificate. Pages which are more based on displaying information such as  history of the club/sport will not be the main focus in the navigation. The  order/positioning of the navigation will prioritise (appear first from left to  right) what the younger audience would be more interested in. For example, the  order of the header will be Home (always put home first), Signup, Ladder, About  and then Contact. This means pages which the older customers are more inclined  to click on (About) will only be slightly inconvenienced as the accessibility  of the pages won&rsquo;t be affected, but will require an extra half a second of scanning  to find. This is how the demographic can be catered to without having to edit  the content itself. &nbsp;</p>
